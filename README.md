# For Potential Employers
__

### Abstract
This repository contains projects from all three branches/skillsets of the modern data profession, ie. analytics, science, and engineering. Throughout those projects, I do my best to demonstrate an intermediate working level of competency with different business intelligcnce tools. Throughout each section are the more universal skillsets of the profession (wrangingling, cleaning, analysis, and dataviz). I want to use this space a professional sandbox, a data workshop on public display to throw in some accountablity and hopefully foster community across junior professionals.
