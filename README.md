# For Potential Employers


### Abstract
This repository contains projects from all three branches/skillsets of the modern data profession, ie. analytics, science, and engineering. Throughout those projects, I do my best to broadly and briefly define the branch of the profession, and demonstrate an intermediate level of competency with different tools as is reasonable within the project. Throughout each branch are the more universal elements of the profession (cleaning, wrangingling, and documentation), but my focus will be on the section's particular skillset. Thank you for your time and consideration.
