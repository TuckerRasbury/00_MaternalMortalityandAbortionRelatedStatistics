# Culture Wars Over Abortion Access Lead to Death and other Spinechilling Statistics - An Ongoing Project

## Abstract
In light of Roe v. Wade  being overturned in June of 2022 by the Supreme Court [[citation]](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/24/1102305878/supreme-court-abortion-roe-v-wade-decision-overturn), I decided to channel my frustrations and technical skills towards exploring the data landscape of abortion access.

Herein, I conduct research and compile datasets with information on the state of abortion access, maternal mortality, and related information to better inform myself. Subsequently, I analyze that information with Python in a google collab data analytics environment, and take it a step further by networking with subject matter experts and journalists via LinkedIn. 

While a passion project, this speaks to my professional interests and personal values. Abortion is healthcare and by doing this project I hope to better inform myself on the data landscape on the subject while also practicing my coding skills thus bridging the gap between armchair academic and useful applicable knowledge.

## Executive Summary - In Progress
As of 11/9/22, my research has yielded a handful of leads on useful data and has led to networking with real journalists.

## Research Questions
01. What does available research say about the effect of changes in abortion access? Why does any of this matter
02. Collected datasets and feedback gained from networking.
03. Mining available data to surface insights.


### 01. What does the research say about abortion access and if it does or does not matter?
The University of Colorado Boulder in no uncertain terms states that "banning abortion nationwide would lead to a 21% increase in the number of pregnancy-related deaths overall and a 33% increase among Black women" [[citation]](https://www.colorado.edu/today/2021/09/08/study-banning-abortion-would-boost-maternal-mortality-double-digits). Furthermore, they state that these deaths would be due to complications of being pregnant and delivering a baby. Deaths due to unsafe abortions or attempted abortions would be in **addition** to those estimates.

### 02. Collected Data and Feedback
- **Collected Data:** [Maternal deaths and mortality rates 2018-2020 [rates per 100k live births]](https://github.com/TuckerRasbury/00_MaternalMortalityandAbortionRelatedStatistics/blob/e83ebfd619306c5c9981265e4f624780afb0bb35/data/VitalStatistics_raw_data.xlsx)
- **Collected Data:** [Guttmacher Data]()
- **Collected Data:** [Nationaland StatePregnancy_PublicUse]()

### 03. Insights Gained from Investigating Data
