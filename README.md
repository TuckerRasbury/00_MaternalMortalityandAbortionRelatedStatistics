# ForPotentialEmployers
This repository contains projects from all three branches of the modern data profession, ie. analytics, science, and engineering. Throughout those projects, I do my best to define and demonstrate an intermediate level of competency with different data science tools as is reasonable within project. Thank you for your time and consideration.
